"""Registration module of DIRECT.

This module contains traditional registration algorithms. The registration algorithms are based on the scikit-image
registration and SimpleITK demons registration algorithms. The registration algorithms are used to estimate the
transformation between two images. The transformation can be used to warp one image to match the other image.
