# Installation

We provide a [Dockerfile](docker) which install DIRECT with a few commands. While recommended due to the use of specific
pytorch features, DIRECT should also work in a virtual environment.

## Requirements

- CUDA 10.2 supported GPU.
- Linux with Python ≥ 3.8
- PyTorch ≥ 1.6

## Common Installation Issues

If you met issues using DIRECT, please first update the repository to the latest version, and rebuild the docker. When
this does not work, create a GitHub issue so we can see whether this is a bug, or an installation problem.
